Reactify - A stimuli based reaction game

The point of this application is to test and record the users reaction times while playing a simple
touch based game. These three games consist of three different types of gameplay typically used
in the common action game. These are:
- Shooting
- Driving
- Dodging
After the games have been played, all the data required to evaluate the players' reactions are stored in
a file that is identified using a unique identifier, and then compared to the other users. 

Shooting
In the shooting game, the player is required to tap on the targets shown on screen as soon as they 
appear. They should then repeat this process until the game is complete.

Driving
In the driving game, the player must tap on either side of the screen as soon as a direction is given.
When the 'Split' direction is shown, the player can choose to move in either direction, and will 'Join' 
the track after this section has finished. If they fail to tap quick enough or the timer runs out, the 
game will end.

Dodging
In the dodging game, up to 3 asteroids will move towards the player, and the directions of these asteroids
will be shown on screen. The player must then tap on the screen to move the ship to that position in order
to dodge the asteroids. The game will end if the timer ends or the player is hit by an asteroid.
